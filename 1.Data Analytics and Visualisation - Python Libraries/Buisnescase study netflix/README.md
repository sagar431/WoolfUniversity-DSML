This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the type of content available on the platform, trends over time, and various attributes related to the shows and movies. The goal is to understand the distribution, popularity, and characteristics of the content on Netflix.

## Project Objectives

1. **Analyze Content Types**: Determine the distribution of movies vs. TV shows.
2. **Explore Content Trends**: Investigate how the number of releases has changed over the years.
3. **Study Attributes**: Examine attributes such as directors, cast, and genres.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and clean the dataset for analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `show_id`: Unique identifier for the show.
- `type`: Type of content (Movie or TV Show).
- `title`: Title of the show.
- `director`: Director of the show (some entries are missing).
- `cast`: Cast members of the show (some entries are missing).
- `country`: Country where the show was produced (some entries are missing).
- `date_added`: Date when the show was added to Netflix.
- `release_year`: Year the show was released.
- `rating`: Rating of the show (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA).
- `duration`: Duration of the show or number of seasons.
- `listed_in`: Categories/genres the show is listed under.

### Trends Over Time

An analysis of the release years indicates a general increase in the number of movies and TV shows released annually, particularly after the early 2000s. This reflects the expansion of the entertainment industry and the rise of streaming platforms.

### Actors and Directors

We identified the most frequent actors and directors in movies and TV shows. For example, **Anupam Kher** is a prominent actor in Netflix movies, while **Takahiro Sakurai** frequently appears in TV shows.

### Genres

Movies and TV shows are categorized into various genres, with "Dramas" and "Documentaries" being common for movies, and "International TV Shows" for TV shows.

## Data Cleaning

We addressed missing values in key fields such as `director`, `cast`, `country`, and `rating`. This process involved filling or removing missing entries to ensure data integrity.

## Visualizations
